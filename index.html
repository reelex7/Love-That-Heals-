      <li>How to Heal After Heartbreak Without Hating Love
Heartbreak can make the world feel empty, silent, and confusing. The pain is not just emotional; it affects your thoughts, your sleep, your confidence, and sometimes even your faith in love itself. But heartbreak is not the end of your story — it is a chapter of transformation.
Healing does not mean forgetting the person. It means learning how to live again without losing yourself. Begin by allowing yourself to feel the pain without judgment. Cry if you must. Write your feelings. Talk to someone safe. Suppressing pain only delays healing.
Next, remove the idea that love failed you. Love did not fail — the relationship simply reached the end of what it could give. Love is still pure, still powerful, still waiting to be experienced in a healthier way.
Take time to rebuild your sense of self. Do small things that remind you of who you are beyond the relationship. Walk. Read. Pray. Laugh. Create new routines that belong only to you.
Finally, forgive — not because they deserve it, but because your heart deserves peace. Forgiveness frees you from carrying yesterday’s wounds into tomorrow’s joy.
Healing is not a race. Be gentle with yourself. Your heart will love again — and when it does, it will love wiser</li>
      <li>10 Signs You Are in a Toxic Relationship (And What To Do)
A toxic relationship drains your spirit instead of strengthening it. Here are signs you should never ignore:
You feel anxious more than you feel safe.
Your partner controls your choices.
Communication feels like walking on eggshells.
You constantly doubt your worth.
There is emotional manipulation.
Your dreams are discouraged.
Trust is broken repeatedly.
Respect is missing.
You are blamed for everything.
You feel lonely even when you’re together.
What to do?
Start by acknowledging the truth. Love is not meant to hurt your soul. Set clear boundaries. Seek wise counsel. Choose your emotional safety. Sometimes the bravest act of love is walking away</li>
